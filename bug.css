The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to specificity and inheritance:

```css
.parent {
  color: blue;
}

.child {
  color: red !important;
}

.parent .child {
  color: green;
}
```

In this example, the `.child` class has the `!important` flag, which overrides the color set by its parent. However, the more specific selector `.parent .child` is used to override the `!important` flag. This behaviour might be unexpected for developers unfamiliar with the specificity rules that consider the number of selectors in a CSS rule.
