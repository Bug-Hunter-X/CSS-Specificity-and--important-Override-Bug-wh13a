The solution involves carefully reviewing the specificity of selectors to avoid the `!important` override. In some cases, removing the `!important` flag itself might be a valid solution, making the CSS easier to maintain and debug.  Here's an example:

```css
.parent {
  color: blue;
}

.child {
  color: red;
}

.parent .child {
  color: green;
}
```

In this corrected version, the specificity of `.parent .child` determines the color to be green without using the `!important` flag. This approach enhances code maintainability and readability.
